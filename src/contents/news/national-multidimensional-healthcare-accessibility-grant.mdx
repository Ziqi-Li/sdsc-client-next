# Amber DeJohn to lead new national healthcare accessibility grant

Amber DeJohn has been named principal investigator for **“National, Multidimensional Measures of Healthcare Accessibility for AD/ADRD Risk Factors,”** funded by the NIH-supported GeoSpatial Evaluation and Community Collaboration (GECC) program.

The project will:

- Build national indicators of equitable access to preventive and clinical services tied to Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD).
- Combine spatial analytics, health data integration, and community-driven metrics to reveal service gaps.
- Deliver interactive tools partners can use to prioritize investments in age-friendly health infrastructure.

This grant strengthens SDSC’s growing portfolio on healthy aging, giving collaborators fresh data to advocate for mobility- and access-focused policy solutions.
