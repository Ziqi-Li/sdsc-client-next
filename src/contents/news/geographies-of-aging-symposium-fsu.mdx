# Geographies of Aging and the Life Course Symposium launches at FSU

The Spatial Data Science Center is helping to launch the first **Geographies of Aging and the Life Course Symposium** at Florida State Universityâ€”an initiative that brings together scholars focused on aging, mobility, and community well-being.

- Amber DeJohn is a co-founder of the symposium series.
- The launch is funded through an internal grant from FSU's College of Social Sciences & Public Policy (COSSPP).
- Programming will highlight spatial, technological, and policy perspectives on healthy aging.

Finalized program details and registration information will be shared as soon as they are available. If you would like to receive updates or get involved, reach out to Amber directly.
