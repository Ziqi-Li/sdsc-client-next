The Spatial Data Science Center is committed to helping provide solutions to some of society's most pressing problems through the power of spatial data analytics. Spatial data consist of locational information as well as attribute information and contain properties such as data dependency, process heterogeneity, and scale sensitivity, which makes careful analysis important.

Vast amounts of spatial data are collected regularly through technologies such as GPS and lend themselves both to visual display and powerful local forms of statistical analysis. Spatial data science encompasses both of these elements to better understand problems in areas such as health, transportation, society, and the environment.

FSU's Spatial Data Science Center contains some of the world's most prominent experts in this field. We are excited to collaborate with partners who see geospatial intelligence as a path toward a healthier, more resilient, and more equitable future.
