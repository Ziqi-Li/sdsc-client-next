I am a health geographer interested in the geographies of aging, which I study through transport accessibility modeling, spatial data analysis, and place-based methods. My research examines how the built environment shapes lifelong health and well-being, with a particular focus on mobility and technology use in later life.

Currently, my work centers on identifying spatial disparities in access to care services and understanding their implications for quality of life among affected populations.
