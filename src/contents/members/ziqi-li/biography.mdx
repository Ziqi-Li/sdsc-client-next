I am a spatial data scientist interested in advancing statistical and machine learning models to understand human behavior across different spatial contexts. I am the developer of GeoShapley, one of the primary developers of Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) and a core developer of Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL). My current work centers on developing spatially explicit machine learning models and improving their interpretability and explainability.
